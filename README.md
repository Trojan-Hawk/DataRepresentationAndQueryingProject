# Data Representation And Querying Project

				GMIT year 3 semester 1 project(2017). 
Written in the go language, using AJAX and implementing the Eliza program.

## Introduction
My name is Timothy Cassidy, I am a 3rd year student in software design and 
program development. I am making this chatbot as part of our Data 
Representation And Querying module. I will be programming this project 
using HTML and Go. I will be using AJAX to update the HTML page without 
reloading and I will be designing the chatbot using the Eliza program as a 
guideline.
	
## Using the Chatbot
To use this chatbot you must first download or clone this gitHub repository.
You can do this by clicking the download button on this repository main page
or you can open up a new console window on your PC/Laptop, navigate to the 
directory you would like the project to be stored in and then type in the 
following commands:

	- git clone https://github.com/Trojan-Hawk/DataRepresentationAndQueryingProject.git
	- cd <cloned directory>
	- git status
	
Git status is a command you will use often to verify the current state of your 
repository and the files it contains. Right now, you should see that you are 
on branch master, everything is up to date with origin/master and your working 
directory is clean.
